This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Markdown Previewer

```
Overview: Develop a Markdown previewer where users can input Markdown text and instantly see the rendered HTML output. 
Key Features: 

1. Markdown Input: Provide a text area where users can type or paste Markdown content. 
2. Live Preview: Display the HTML-rendered output in real-time as users type or update the Markdown content. 
3. Customization: Allow users to customize the editor with options such as choosing a different theme or adjusting font size. 
4. Export: Enable users to download the rendered HTML content as a file. 5. Syntax Highlighting: Implement syntax highlighting for the Markdown input area to enhance readability. 

Technologies: 
● React for building the user interface. 
● NextJS as React Framework. 
● Markdown parser library (e.g., Marked.js) for converting Markdown to HTML. ● Optional: React libraries for customization (e.g., react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlighting).

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
