## Markdown Previewer
Deployed [here](https://markdown-previewer-mlm.netlify.app/)

```
Overview: Develop a Markdown previewer where users can input Markdown text and instantly see the rendered HTML output. 
Key Features: 

1. Markdown Input: Provide a text area where users can type or paste Markdown content. 
2. Live Preview: Display the HTML-rendered output in real-time as users type or update the Markdown content. 
3. Customization: Allow users to customize the editor with options such as choosing a different theme or adjusting font size. 
4. Export: Enable users to download the rendered HTML content as a file. 5. Syntax Highlighting: Implement syntax highlighting for the Markdown input area to enhance readability. 

Technologies:

● React for building the user interface.
● NextJS as React Framework.
● Markdown parser library (e.g., Marked.js) for converting Markdown to HTML.
● Optional: React libraries for customization (e.g., react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlighting).
